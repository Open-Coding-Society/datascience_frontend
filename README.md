# Introduction

**Data Science Pages** is a student-led project designed to teach and promote data science concepts. Inspired by Mr. Mortensen's curriculum, this repository serves as both a learning tool and a collaborative teaching platform. It offers educational content such as tutorials, blogs, coding notebooks, and an interactive single-page resource to guide students through key data science principles.

---

## Purpose

This project has three main goals:

- **Teach Data Science**: Offer lessons on topics like statistics, machine learning, data visualization, and Python.
- **Promote Peer Learning**: Allow students to create and share educational content.
- **Provide a Central Hub**: Host a single-page website with curated explanations and resources covering major topics in data science.

---

## Key Features

- **Single Page Learning Hub**  
  A centralized page with summaries and visualizations of major data science concepts: variables, functions, algorithms, data analysis, and more.

- **Interactive Coding Notebooks**  
  Jupyter Notebooks with hands-on code and walkthroughs for topics like:
  - Pandas & NumPy
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn
  - Titanic Dataset Explorations
  - Linear Regression and Classification

- **Tutorials and Blogs**  
  Student-authored tutorials, walkthroughs, and reflections on learning and teaching data science.

- **Live Demos**  
  Flask and Python APIs (e.g., Titanic API) that let students analyze and transform real-world data.
