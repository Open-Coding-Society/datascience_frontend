## Data Structures 1 

> Data Structures 1 serves as the third trimester for the Computer Science Principles course. It is the capstone for non-computer science majors/minors and prepares other students to complete the PUSD computer science pathway. Data Structures 1 focuses on creating computer programs independently and includes AP review and AP project time. The course utilizes JavaScript and Python languages to instruct on the imperative and object-oriented programming paradigms. Topics covered include graphical user interfaces, input and output, lists, dictionaries, databases, searching, sorting, and algorithm analysis.

- Prerequisites: AP Computer Science Principles 1,2
- Meets UC/CSU G requirements


## Data Structures 2

> Data Structures 2 serves as the third trimester for the Computer Science "A" course and is the capstone for the Del Norte Computer Science Pathway. It is designed as a companion to AP Computer Science 'A'. This course focuses on basic data structures, algorithms, and includes AP preparation for College Board multiple-choice questions (MCQs) and free-response questions (FRQs). The course utilizes the JavaScript and Java languages to instruct on object-oriented programming paradigm programming and design. Topics covered include searching, sorting, hashing, algorithm analysis, collections, lists, stacks, queues, trees, sets, dictionaries, and graphs. The course concludes with team-oriented project-based learning and a final project.

- Prerequisites: AP Computer Science ‘A’ 1,2
- Meets UC/CSU G requirements
- Data Structures 1,2 receives Articulated College Credit to Mira Costa CC for "CS 113: Basic Data Structures and Algorithms". Mira Costa CC requires and provides free registration to receive UC college credit.
