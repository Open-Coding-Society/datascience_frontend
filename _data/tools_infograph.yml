Title: "Feature Overview"
Description: "The features are ranked in progression from simplest features to more complex."
Topics:
  - title: "Sickness Prediction"
    image: "sick.png"
    link: "/chart"
    alt: "Account Creation"
    keyPoints:
      - "UCI Database"
      - "Predictive Model"
      - "Simplest within the website"
    subtitle: "Description"
    description: "This is a feature that takes the qualities (Age and Sex) and the symptoms (Fever, Cough, Shortness of Breath, Chest Pain) of users and predicts survival. This was made using information in the Influenza symptoms and death cases."
  - title: "Travel Reccomendations"
    image: "travel.png"
    link: "/travel"
    alt: "GitHub Repository"
    keyPoints:
      - "Survey and self made data"
      - "Predictive Model"
      - "Comes after Sickness Prediction due to added input systems"
    subtitle: "Description"
    description: "This takes pre-made inputs from a dropdown menu concerning the season (summer, winter, spring, fall), activity (relax, beach, hike, etc), budget (high, low, medium), and continent. It then outputs a specific country that suits the user's expectations."
  - title: "College Predictor"
    image: "college.png"
    link: "/college"
    alt: "GitHub Pages"
    keyPoints:
      - "Numerical inputs"
      - "Data based off of UC acceptance results"
      - "Different formatting of outputs (numerical and text), leading to a more complex feature"
    subtitle: "Description"
    description: "This takes inputs like GPA, SAT score, ACT score, AP class count, and extracurriculars to provide a UC that would best fit the user, as well as the user's predicted acceptance chance percentage."
  - title: "Pet Trainer"
    image: "happy.png"
    link: "/train"
    alt: "Operating Systems"
    keyPoints:
      - "Machine Learning"
      - "Given database that the feature uses"
      - "Image outputs as well as animation and other features included, can adapt Data Science in various ways."
    subtitle: "Description"
    description: "This takes inputs on a number scale of 1-5 on things like how much food users give to a pet, how much users play with the pet, and how much sleep the pet gets. Based on these numbers, the model will predict the pet's happiness on a scale of 1-10 and display a progress bar with animation, change the image of the pet's facial expression, and display a speech bubble based on the pet's thoughts."
  - title: "Score Predictor"
    image: "score.png"
    link: "/score"
    alt: "VSCode"
    keyPoints:
      - "Dataset from previous test scores, found online"
      - "Linear Regresssion"
    subtitle: "Description"
    description: "his uses a slider bar and asks for the user's test score (MCQ and FRQ). Based on the data inputted, a graph will be displayed showing the user's score compared to other test takers as well as the predicted score result. The graph is not something that is static, but users can physically see it move/ change as they adjust the slider bar."
  - title: "Titanic Model"
    image: "titanic.png"
    link: "/titanic"
    alt: "VSCode"
    keyPoints:
      - "Utilizes the Titanic dataset"
      - "Has bargraphs, pie charts (other ways to display data)"
      - "Saves to backend through SQL"
    subtitle: "Description"
    description: "his takes user information (name, sex, age) and fictional information like passenger class, place of embarkation, siblings onboard, etc. It then predicts whether you will survive the Titanic or not. There is an option for users to publicly store their results, in which case the result is stored permanently on the website and allows others to view it. There is also a pie chart that is freshly created based on the predicted Titanic survivability score."
