    "Have you ever wondered what your chances are of surviving a nasty case of influenza? In this project, we set out to answer that question using data science and machine learning. Our model doesn‚Äôt just guess ‚Äî it makes predictions based on real-world data and statistical analysis. Let‚Äôs break down how it works.\n",

Since this is a disease survivability tracker, it has the potential to be adapted into a survey that patients can take to diagnose themselves with different diseases and their survivability.

This data is based on previous cases of diseases, so it can be used by medical students to study how different variables like age/ other symptoms affect survivability. \n",
